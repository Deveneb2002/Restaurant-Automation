Project Description 
This  project  develops  a  computerized  system  to  help  restaurant  personnel  coordinate 
their  activities  and  improve  their  services,  and  for  the  management  to  track  business 
growth and create future plans.  The goal for this project is to introduce automation in 
privately-owned  restaurants,  that  is,  small  to  medium-sized  establishments.  Typical 
problems  restaurant  personnel are  facing include:  coordination  of  their  work  activities, 
anticipating  and  handling  periods  of  low/high  patron  traffic,  recognizing  trends  early 
enough to take advantage of bestsellers or abandon the flops, lowering operating costs, 
and  increasing  efficiency/productivity  and  profits.  Many  restaurants  are  still  operated 
using pen and paper methods, with little or no automation. Patrons enter the facility to 
be  greeted  by  a  host,  who  often  times has a “dry erase” diagram of the tables, 
maintained on a blackboard. The host can see the status of the tables based on whether 
or not they or someone else physically updates the diagram. Once seated a waiter tends 
to the costumers by jotting down the orders onto a piece of carbon paper and delivers it 
to  the  kitchen  for  proper  food  preparation.  The  waiter  then  has  to  periodically  check 
back  to  find  out  when  the  meal  is  ready.  When  the  food  is  done,  the  piece  of  carbon 
paper is saved for proper record keeping by the management. This “old fashion” system 
works but yields a large amount of  tab receipts, wastes a lot of time and is simply out-
of-date. In old fashion systems, waiters have to carry pads around to take orders, always 
have a working pen and be sure to keep each bill organized and “synchronized” with the 
proper table. 
 
This  project  computerizes  restaurant  operation  so  that  all  information  pertaining  to 
patron’s orders and staff activity will be conveniently shared and stored over the 
restaurant’s intranet. Hosts will be able to view table status with a click of a button. The 
wait staff will be able to enter the patron’s orders quickly and efficiently and then have 
it  electronically  delivered  to  the  kitchen.  The  kitchen  staff  will  be  able  to  view  the 
incoming  orders  and  notify  the  proper  wait  staff  when  the  food  is  ready.  Bus  boys  will 
be  able  to  view  real-time  floor  status  allowing  them  to  know  which  tables  are  clean, 
dirty,  or  occupied. Most  importantly,  all of  the restaurant information  is  organized and 
saved  in  the  system  database  for  the  management  viewing  and  archival.  The  analysis 
will consist of by-the-day and by-the-hour breakdowns of: revenue and revenue 
percentage per menu item, menu item popularity, Personnel efficiency, average 
turnaround time (how long patrons spend in the restaurant), average preparation time 
5 
 
(time  from  when  the  order  is  placed  to  when  it  is  ready).  All  data  is  automatically 
collected  and  processed  allowing  management  to  focus  on  analyzing  the  data  rather 
than calculating it.
