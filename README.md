Project Description 
-------------------
The goal of this project was to create a program to make the slow and monotonous task of giving and taking orders in a restaurant more efficient. With our program, a customer can walk into a restaurant, sit down, and click what they would like to eat. The order is sent straight to the chef with no walking time, no communication time between waiter and customer or waiter and chef. 

This project allows all information pertaining to patron’s orders and staff activity to be shared and stored over the restaurant’s internet. Waitstaff will be able to view table status from anywhere in the restaurant. Guests will be able to enter their orders on their own and then have it electronically delivered to the kitchen as well as print out their receipt at their own pace. The chefs will be able to view the incoming orders and notify the proper wait staff when the food is ready.

Most importantly, the managers will be able to view the information that is organized and saved in the system database. All data is automatically collected and processed allowing management to focus on analyzing the data rather than calculating it. This is especially important for things like tracking popularities of items which can be difficult to do manually, but can efficiently be done by our system.
